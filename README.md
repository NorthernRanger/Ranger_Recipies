# Ranger Recipes
A simple mod for The Long Dark that adds some new cooking recipes.
I always felt that the cooking recipe system was heavily underused with so much potential.
This is my attempt to bridge this gap.

Current features include (relatively untested and checked for balance):
A collection of stews + their respective cooking recipes: Bear, Moose and Wolf.

Cattail Rhizome: The root of a Cat Tail, edible when cooked.


Planned features for now:
- Mixed meat stew
- Different stews with herbs, plants or berries mixed in
- Recipes other than stews
